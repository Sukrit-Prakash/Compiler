MyLang: A Python-Based Custom InterpreterA custom programming language implementation built from scratch in Python. This project demonstrates the core principles of language design, including lexical analysis, parsing, and interpretation.🚀 Project OverviewMyLang is an interpreted language that supports arithmetic operations, variable assignments, unary operators, and memory management. It uses a Recursive Descent Parser and a Tree-Walking Interpreter to execute code in real-time.🏗️ The Architecture (The Pipeline)The language functions through a three-stage pipeline. Data flows sequentially from raw text to executable logic.1. The Lexer (Lexical Analyzer)File: lexer.pyRole: The "Scanner." It reads the raw source code character by character.Process: It groups characters into meaningful chunks called Tokens.Example:Input: x = 5 + 10Output: [ID('x'), ASSIGN, INTEGER(5), PLUS, INTEGER(10)]Key Features: Handles multi-digit integers, ignores whitespace, and identifies keywords/identifiers.2. The Parser (Syntax Analyzer)File: parser.pyRole: The "Grammar Police." It takes the list of tokens and validates them against the language's grammar rules.Process: It organizes tokens into a hierarchical structure called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It handles Operator Precedence (e.g., * happens before +) via a hierarchy of methods (factor → term → expr).Example:The flat list 5 + 3 * 2 becomes a tree where * is deeper than +, ensuring 3*2 is calculated first.3. The Interpreter (Runtime)File: interpreter.pyRole: The "Executor." It traverses the AST recursively.Process: It visits each node in the tree and performs the actual Python computation (addition, subtraction, memory storage).Key Features:Symbol Table: A Python dictionary (GLOBAL_MEMORY) acts as the language's memory, storing variable values.🛠️ Current FeaturesArithmetic: +, -, *, /Parentheses: ( ) for grouping expressions.Unary Operators: Negative numbers (e.g., -5, --5).Variables: Assignment (x = 10) and retrieval (x + 5).Case Insensitivity: (In logic handling)🆚 How is this different from "Real" Compilers?While MyLang follows the standard structure of a compiler, there are distinct differences between this educational project and industrial compilers like GCC (C++) or V8 (JavaScript).FeatureMyLang (Interpreter)Real Compilers (e.g., C++, Java)Execution ModeInterpreted. The source code is read and executed line-by-line immediately.Compiled. Source code is translated into Machine Code (0s and 1s) or Bytecode before it runs.PerformanceSlower. The overhead of "walking the tree" happens every time the code runs.Faster. The CPU executes the optimized binary directly.MemoryUses Python's internal memory management.Manages stack and heap memory manually (allocating addresses).Error CheckingRuntime errors (crashes when it hits the bad line).Static Analysis (finds errors before the code even runs).Intermediate RepUses an AST directly.Uses IR (Intermediate Representation) (like LLVM IR) for optimization before machine code generation.🏃 How to RunEnsure all files (tokens.py, lexer.py, parser.py, interpreter.py, main.py) are in the same directory.Run the shell:Bashpython main.py
